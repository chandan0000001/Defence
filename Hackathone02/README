# Second01 ‚Äî Static Web Project

**Live Demo:** https://second01.netlify.app/

---

##  Project Description

Second01 is a static, visually engaging web page built purely with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It showcases animations, layout effects, and a dynamic ‚Äúsun / celestial‚Äù element (or whatever your visual metaphor is) as you scroll or view on different screen sizes.

##  Structure

| File / Folder             | Purpose |
|---------------------------|---------|
| `index.html`              | The main HTML page |
| `style.css`               | Core styling, layout, media queries |
| `image.png` / other imgs  | Assets for visual elements |
| `README.md`               | This documentation |

##  Tech Stack & Tools

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, Animations, Transitions)
- Responsive design using **media queries**

No JavaScript or external libraries used (for now). Keeps things simple and fast.



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Improvements

- The ‚Äúsun‚Äù element (or the main visual) doesn‚Äôt center properly on smaller/mobile devices.  
  ‚Üí Could be due to fixed widths, absolute positioning, or missing responsive offsets.
- Some image assets may overflow or stretch on extreme viewport sizes.
- Accessibility (alt attributes, contrast) can be improved.
