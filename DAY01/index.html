    <h2>Who is Frontend developer ?</h2>
    <p>A Frontend Developer is a professional who specializes in creating the user-facing part of a websiteâ€”everything a person sees and interacts with in their browser. They are the architects of the digital experience, responsible for turning a static design into a living, breathing, and interactive webpage.</p>
